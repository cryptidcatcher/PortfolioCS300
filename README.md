CS 300 Portfolio - Jasmine Procaccini

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In this course we were helping sort classes for a computer science program at an imaginary university, ABCU. We created software that displayed a menu of options, took user input, and could store and print data from specific courses including their prerequisites and a method to sort classes alphanumerically.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

We learned about different data structures in this course and made pseudocode for various different potential ways to accomplish our goal. This offered an easy way to compare and contrast different methods and find out what was best for our client specifically. I think that this really helped my understanding of the basics of different data structures- it's one thing to read about sorting trees vs vectors but actually creating pseudocode for a specific project and thinking through how each type of data structure may impact it really helped me actually understand the pros and cons of each type.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I found the Zybooks textbook quite helpful! If I got stuck on a certain part of an assignment, I was able to go back and read through the principles of whatever I was working on at the time and look at examples of how to create similar code. If I was still stuck, I would look for acedemic articles on the topic to help me understand better.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

While I had a basic understanding of the concept of different data structures before, I think that this course gave me a much better of how to actually apply those concepts in practice. I think that I tend to favor vectors because that's what I'm most familiar and comfortable with, but this class has given me the confidence to branch out more in future projects, which I think is very important. ]

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I think I'm starting to get a bit quicker at writing pseudocode and programs, which is very nice! I'm starting to feel a little more comfortable with my coding, even though I'm still definitely a novice. I need to work on adding more comments in my code to increase readability, but I think this course has significantly improved the adaptability of my code. 
Thank you! :)
